Note that Natrel’s\\nimagery is well below local brands. Natrel holds a stronger position \\nwithin the Lactose Free and \\nOrganic segments, despite some \\ndeclines vs. 2019.\\nNatrel leads the Lactose Free \\ncategory in the Atlantic region, with \\nstrong levels of awareness and \\npurchase compared to others in the \\ncategory. That said, aided awareness \\nappears to have plummeted slightly \\nvs. 2019.\\nWithin the Organic Milk category , \\nNatrel maintains a strong position as \\nwell albeit some competition from \\nPresident’s Choice (PC). \\nSpontaneous awareness for Natrel\\nappears to have declined vs. 2019 \\nwhile PC makes some gains on ‘brand \\nbought most often’.Local Eastern brands perform well \\noverall, with Farmers, \\nNorthumberland and Central \\nDairies maintaining a strong \\ncategory lead.\\nThere continues to be a strong \\npreference for locally sourced milk \\nin the Atlantic, with a number of local \\nbrands competing head -to-head on \\nkey indicators of equity.\\nFarmers, Central Dairies and \\nNorthumberland maintain a \\nsignificant lead across the competitive \\nset on awareness, purchase and \\nconsideration.\\nThe perception of being from the \\nAtlantic region is a key advantage for \\nthese brands, as they all gain \\nmomentum on the idea of providing a \\n‘warm and welcoming’ feeling .Fairlife managed to increase its \\nvisibility, with m ore consumers \\nclaiming to be aware of Fairlife vs. \\n2019 . However, this awareness is yet \\nto translate into purchase –which \\nappears to have declined for the \\nbrand.\\nWhile it continues to build its presence \\nin the overall milk category, Fairlife is \\nalready ahead of competitors in the \\nProtein Enriched category .
